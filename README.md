Embark on an unforgettable adventure in "Attentive Company Kick-off 2024: THE RPG," a browser-based role-playing game where every choice you make shapes your destiny. 

You step into the shoes of a slightly inebriated employee at the much-anticipated company kick-off, held at the vibrant heart of Las Vegas. With $200 less in your pocket, a hint of fatigue creeping in, and your dignity hanging by a thread, the stakes have never been higher. With only 10 hours until check-out, the choices you make in these final hours will define your entire experience.

"Attentive Company Kick-off 2024: THE RPG" challenges you to balance three critical attributes: money, endurance, and dignity. Every decision impacts these facets of your character, from engaging in high-stakes gambling to choosing a more conservative path of interaction with your colleagues and the unique personalities you encounter. Will you recover from your initial losses and emerge victorious, or will the dazzling lights of Vegas claim yet another soul?

Featuring an open-ended gameplay experience, this game allows you to respond to scenarios in a manner that reflects your personal strategy and values. Whether it's boosting your endurance with a strong coffee, increasing your cash flow through savvy or desperate measures, or navigating social situations to maintain or reclaim your dignity, every action has consequences.

Prepare to navigate through a series of challenges and opportunities, with each turn presenting a new scenario requiring your decision. After 10 actions, the game concludes, and your fate will be determined by the state of your attributes. If any of them hit zero, the game ends prematurely, highlighting the importance of strategic planning and balance.
